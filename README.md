# Bluetooth Controlled DIY Arm

Robotic Arms are a fascination to every Engineer out there. As fancy as they sound they are that much more complex to build as well as control one. Long equations of Inverse Kinematics and much more theory goes behind it. Hence, this Repo throws some light on a DIY approach in which you can freely control your DIY built arm with your mobile phone. This repo is mostly for beginners willing to explore devices like Arduino and Modules like HC-05.

To make this DIY Arm all one needs is a basic understanding of Arduino, Servos and HC-05. Even without these one can start with this project and learn in the process.

The exact DIY guide will be updated soon.
